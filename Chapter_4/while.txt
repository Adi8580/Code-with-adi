# we take one variable ( i ) then i gave him one value.

# The value is 0.

# Then i use while condition [ while(i<5) ] to check if i is less than 5.

# If i is less than 5 then the condition is true and the loop will execute.

# And i will be printed on terminal printf("Happy Birthday\n");.

# i is incremented by 1.

# i = i + 1. i will print 5  times on terminal because i is less than 5 in first 5 iterations.

# Because i value is change 0 to 1 Our Output will be print 5 time / loop will execute 5 times.

# After some time i will be 5 and the condition will be false and the loop will stop.

# We can't write [ while(i>=4) ] it goes into infinite loop.

# Lets suppose i = 5 then 5 is iterate with [ i + 1] Output will be 6 which is greater than 5.

# Then  the loop will be infinite because the condition is always true.

#  So we can't write [ while(i>=4) ] it goes into infinite loop.
