:- if i have only one condition in conditional statement

int main()
{
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    if (age >= 25)
    {
        printf("age is greater than 25");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("age is less than 25");
    }
}

:- i should need use only if or else statements

:- [if and else]

:- if i have  two or more conditions in if else statements

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    int age;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &age);
    if (age >= 25)
    {
        printf("age is greater than 25");
    }
    else if(age >= 15)
    {
        printf("age is greater than 15");
    }
    else if(age >= 8)
    {
        printf("age is greater than 8");
    }
    else if(age>4)
    {
        printf(" age is greater than 4");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("age is less than 4");
    }
}

:- Then i can  use if else if else statements to check multiple conditions.
:- But if i have only one condition then i can use only if else statements. 

:- Thats  all about if else statements in c programming.
:- I hope you have understood the concept of if else statements in c programming.
